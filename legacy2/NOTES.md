FYI
`npm install mocha@6.0.0 --save-dev`

has multiple vunlerabilities, and if ignore low impact dev deps rule is enabled then some will be auto-dismissed (see notes for explanation of the rule that dismissed it)

others are not low impact and so are not dismessed (open still) and subject to sec updates if enabled
